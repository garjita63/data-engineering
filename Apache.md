# What Is Apache?

Apache is a free open-source web server developed and maintained by Apache Software Foundation. It is primarily designed for Linux but runs on other major platforms, such as Windows and OpenVMS.

Aside from being fast and reliable, Apache introduces the concept of modules - smaller programs that extend the server's core functionality. The modules make the web server customizable and able to adapt to many usage scenarios.
