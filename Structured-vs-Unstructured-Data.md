## What Is Structured Data?

Structured data is any type of data organized in a specific way. The data has a fixed format, such as tables with rows and columns.

![image-20230815102841314](images/image-20230815102841314.png)

Structured data resides in various formats that support a table-like structure. The data is simple to search through, sort, and analyze with [database tools](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/best-database-software) or in spreadsheets.

### Structured Data Formats

Some common examples of structured data include:

- **Relational databases** are the most common way to store structured data. Columns represent different fields, while each row is a data record.
- **Spreadsheets** store data in a table format. Columns represent individual variables, whereas rows hold specific values.
- **CSV (Comma Separated Values) files** use plain-text format to store data in fields and rows.
- **XML (Extensible Markup Language) files** are used for storing and transporting data, while tags and attributes define data elements.
- **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) files** are a lightweight storage and data exchange format that uses a key-value pair structure.

**Note:** JSON and XML are a form of **semi-structured data**. The two formats do not have a table-like structure but include tags, markers, and hierarchies to separate elements.

### Structured Data Examples

Structured data is easy to model into a table format. Examples of structured data include:

- **People information**. A database with any information about people uses structured data. For example, first and last name, ID number, date of birth, email address, and phone number.
- **Products data**. A product list is easy to translate into structured data. Fields include a product name, number in stock, price, and an image link.
- **Geographic information**. A list of places is simple to represent with structured data. Different data types include city names, country names, population, latitude, and longitude.
- **Financial data**. Any form of financial data has a structured form. Examples include credit card information or stock market prices.

- **R libraries** for statistical programming and graphics work with structured data.

## What Is Unstructured Data?

Unstructured data is data that does not follow a fixed structure format. The data model is schema-less and cannot use traditional data processing methods.

![image-20230815103518959](images/image-20230815103518959.png)

The data includes all data formats in structured data (text, dates, numbers), and extra complex unstructured data, such as video, audio, and documents.

### Unstructured Data Formats

Some examples of unstructured data are:

- **Documents**, such as Word documents, PDFs, and other text-based information.
- **Images** in formats such as JPEG and PNG.
- **Audio** data in various formats, such as WAV or MP3.
- **Video** files in MP4, AVI, and other formats.
- **Sensor data** with streams from sensors in IoT devices. For example, data from smartwatches and various other devices and sensor systems.
- **Social media posts** from platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.
- **Emails** with many fields and various data types and attachments.

### Unstructured Data Examples

Unstructured data exists in a variety of applications and environments. Some examples of unstructured data include:

- **Communication records**. Chat records, messaging, chatbot, and meeting platform data. This includes text, images, videos, audio, and documents. Communication data is useful from a sales and marketing perspective.
- **Medical data**. Healthcare records contain both machine-generated and human-input data. Records from medical devices include images and sensor data. Information from medical personnel has a document form. Both contain useful data from a medical perspective.
