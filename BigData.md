# What Is Big Data?

Big data is a term for large, hard-to-manage sets of structured, semi-structured, or unstructured data that a company can "mine" for valuable insights. The main characteristics of big data are the so-called three Vs: wide variety, large volume, and high velocity. Big data analysis is vital to machine learning projects, predictive modeling, and advanced analytics.
